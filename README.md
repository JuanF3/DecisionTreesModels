# DecisionTreesModels

This is the first dataset to work in Kaggle, I have learn more thing in other platforms, working with more datasets in different data science stuffs and different activities related with machine learning. This time I want to put in practice all that I have done. Starting from the bottom with this project.

In this exercise we start using a decision tree, the simplest way to explain a machine learning model for non-experts, we evaluate its accuracy with the database of passengers who will or will not survive on the titanic. Then it is extrapolated to two other decision tree based models to try to get a better accuracy of the data: Random Forest and Gradient boosted regression trees. 

This application is based on the theory of the book "Introduction to machine learning with Python by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller, Sarah Guido using the notes on decision tree based models.
